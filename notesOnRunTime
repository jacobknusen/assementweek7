the doublerappend uses.push and will take the same ammount of
time for the equation and is o(1)

The doublerInsert uses .unshift and will go through the whole array
 each time making it take longer over time and is O(n)

.push is o(1) and takes the same time to run the function that will push it,
process it in a liner type. scales faster even though it started slow 

.unshift is O(n) itll take longer the larger the array is. 
scales slower even though it started out faster
